# CommandCenterControlProgram
This project is a **Tkinter-based Command Center Control Interface**.   It communicates through a serial (UART) connection, reads incoming data, decodes the custom protocol, and displays it in real time on the GUI.   It simulates the communication between a commander and a soldier in an embedded system environment.
